Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints. Follow up after 15 days.\"')]"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the path to the embedding model\nmodelPath = \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2\"\n\n# GPU acceleration\nmodel_kwargs = {'device':'cuda'}\n\n# Create a dictionary with encoding options\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': False}\n\n# Initialize an instance of HuggingFaceEmbeddings with the specified parameters\nembeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(\n    model_name=modelPath,     \n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs, \n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs\n)\ntext = \"Why are you a doctor?\"\nquery_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)\nquery_result[:3]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-04T10:56:43.940752Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-04T10:56:43.941395Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-04T10:56:48.063629Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-04T10:56:43.941366Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-04T10:56:48.062865Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"<ipython-input-6-1ba9e29322e9>:11: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.2 and will be removed in 1.0.
