# RAG-with-LLaMA-3.1-and-LangChain
This repository demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LLaMA 3.1 8B and LangChain. The project integrates these components to create a robust system for knowledge retrieval and question answering.

Features

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines external knowledge retrieval with the generative power of LLaMA 3.1 8B.

LangChain Integration: Leverages LangChain for structured data pipelines and workflows.

HuggingFace Integration: Uses HuggingFace datasets, embeddings, and models for natural language processing tasks.

Requirements

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

GPU-enabled system (optional, for faster processing)

Python Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Additional Tools

HuggingFace Hub: Ensure you have an account and API token.

Pre-trained models from HuggingFace: Download and configure models as outlined in the notebook.

Usage

Clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your_username/rag-with-llama```
```cd rag-with-llama```

Install the dependencies.

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```jupyter notebook llama-rag.ipynb```

Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load the LLaMA 3.1 model.

Configure HuggingFace Embeddings.

Set up LangChain for data retrieval.

Run RAG workflows.
